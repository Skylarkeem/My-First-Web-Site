    <strong><u>Tennis</u></strong> is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single
    opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
    Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow
    rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
    The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent
    is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball
    validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
