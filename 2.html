<p> <strong><u>Swimming</u></strong> is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of
  one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or
  open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most
  popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke,
  breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events,
  four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley
  relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered
  as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.<br>
